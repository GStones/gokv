gokv documentation
==================

The basic usage is shown in the repository's root [README](../README.md).

Implementation-specific documentation can be found in the Godoc of the subpackages. An overview of all subpackage Godocs can be found on the Godoc site of the main package: <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/philippgille/gokv#section-directories>.

This documentation only contains documentation that's not as purely technical as the Godoc, and not as exemplary as the repository's root README.
